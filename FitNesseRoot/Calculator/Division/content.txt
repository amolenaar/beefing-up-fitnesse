In the Awesome Calculator it is possible to divide numbers. The result is not represented as a rational number (e.g. 1/2 = 0.5), but should remain a fraction.

Here are some examples defined of how such calculation should work (''numerator'' / ''denominator'' = ''result''):

|Calculate Division           |
|numerator|denominator|result?|
|4        |2          |2      |
|1        |3          |1/3    |
|3        |12         |1/4    |
